                <p>A few months ago I cancelled my hosting and server accounts and moved all my websites to the cloud. I tried it <strong>as an experiment</strong>; never for a second I thought it would work this well. I did the switch out of impulse: I was pissed. I was pissed at the hosting companies charging so much, having such crappy support, and much downtime. I’m very glad I switched.</p>

                <p>This is the text under the <strong>header2</strong></p>
                <p>The drop that spilled the cup came one day of February 2012, when all my websites (folders) <strong>were deleted</strong> somehow. Because I considered paying $20 per month for simply hosting my files was enough, I didn’t enable the backup option (it was an extra $2 per month, if I remember correctly). So that day came, and I went straight to their support ticketing system. The dude that was assigned to me was not helpful at all and said there was nothing to be done. My last backup of the websites was in December 2011.</p>
