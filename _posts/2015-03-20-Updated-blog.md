#With spring comes spring cleaning!

Cleaned up my blog as well as gave it a new frontend look that should look familar to those of you who use Medium. 

Like every web developer ever I almost rolled my own blogging platform with Ruby. I actually had half of it built before I realized how little I was actually using the server side.  

So in the end static site generation just makes sense for a blog. 

Plus with some extra tweaking I was able to added a nifty searchbar built with React.js. More on that to come in the future.
